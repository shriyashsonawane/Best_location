# Best_location
This project involved the  **K-Means Clustering algorithm**  to find the best accommodation for people in Pune or any place by classifying accommodation for incoming people on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget, and proximity to the location.
It involved **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis** for feature selection.
The data of location is fetched from the foursquare **API** and plotted the location using the **folium map**.
